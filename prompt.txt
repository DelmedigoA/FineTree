You are extracting financial-statement annotations from a single page image into a strict JSON schema.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no comments, no explanations).

Schema (must match exactly, including key spelling):
{
  "meta": {
    "entity_name": "<string|null>",
    "page_num": "<string|null>",
    "type": "balance_sheet|income_statement|cash_flow|notes|contents_page|title|declaration|profits|other",
    "title": "<string|null>"
  },
  "facts": [
    {
      "bbox": { "x": <number>, "y": <number>, "w": <number>, "h": <number> },
      "value": "<string>",
      "note": "<string|null>",
      "is_beur": "<boolean|null>",
      "beur_num": "<string|null>",
      "refference": "<string>",
      "date": "<string|null>",
      "path": ["<string>", "..."],
      "currency": "ILS|USD|EUR|GBP|null",
      "scale": 1|1000|1000000|null,
      "value_type": "amount|%|null"
    }
  ]
}

Extraction rules:
1. Extract ALL numeric facts visible in the table (including negatives in parentheses and totals).
1.1 Also extract placeholder values such as "-", "—", "–", or similar dash symbols when they appear as cell values.
1.2 Treat dash placeholders as valid facts, not as missing rows. Keep them in `value` exactly as shown.
1.3 Do not skip a fact only because its value is a dash. If a cell exists in the statement structure, include it.
2. `bbox` must tightly cover the numeric value text only (not full row label), in pixel coordinates of the original image.
3. Keep `value` as text exactly as shown (including commas, parentheses, percent sign).
4. `note`: for open-text footnotes or inline textual qualifiers tied to the specific fact (e.g., asterisk note like `*without debt insurance`); otherwise null.
5. `is_beur`: true when the fact is tied to a beur/footnote context, false when explicitly not, null if unknown.
6. `beur_num`: beur/footnote number or id tied to this fact (e.g., "5", "2ה׳"); otherwise null.
7. Use `refference` (exact misspelling) from note/reference column (e.g., 5, 6, "2ה׳"); if none, use "".
8. Build `path` using axis order, not just row labels.
9. `currency`: infer from page header (e.g., "שקלים חדשים" => "ILS"), else null.
10. `scale`: 1 unless header indicates thousands/millions.
11. `value_type`: "amount" unless the fact is a percentage ("%").
12. `date`: map by year column (e.g., 2023 => "31.12.2023", 2022 => "31.12.2022") if page says year ended Dec 31; otherwise null if unknown.
13. `meta.type`: use "profits" for "דוחות על הפעילויות"; otherwise choose best enum value.
14. No duplicate facts. Sort `facts` top-to-bottom, then left-to-right.
15. Output UTF-8 Hebrew directly (not escaped unicode sequences).
16. Do not encode dimensions in `path` if they already have dedicated fields:
    - Time/period (year/date) -> use `date`.
    - Metric format (amount/percent) -> use `value_type`.
    - Currency -> use `currency`.
    - Unit scale (thousands/millions) -> use `scale`.
17. For dash placeholder facts, still populate all other fields (`bbox`, `path`, `date`, `refference`, etc.) from the same row/column context.

Path hierarchy rule (very important):
- Build `path` in this exact order:
  1) Horizontal-axis hierarchy first (row-side structure, top-to-bottom), including row group -> subgroup -> line item.
  2) Vertical-axis hierarchy second (column-side structure), but include only business semantics not already represented by dedicated fields.
- In other words: `path = [horizontal elements..., vertical elements...]`.
- Keep labels exactly as written in the source language.
- Do not invent hierarchy levels; include only levels that are explicitly visible or unambiguously implied by table structure.
